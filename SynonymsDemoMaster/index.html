    <h1>Welcome to the Synonym Demo, Version 1</h1>
    <p>No fancy stuff, just a bare bones demo. Input files are loaded automatically.
       After some background and motivation a series of buttons takes you through the code execution.
       At each stage you can save the file, with the exception of the last stage that produces 
       the Shima Seiki Apex sizing file.
     <br><br>

      The UI synonyms design prototype will let you change the input files. 
      Or you can do this by hand in the code. Note well this code is pre-alpha! It is a first draft!

    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <p>When designing a garment, Jackie Altmeter has to translate a
      customer tech pack sizing chart to an APEX specification by hand based
      on her interpretation of the terminology in the teck pack.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>These are the steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start an APEX session by pointing and clicking to the sizing chart.</li>
      <img src="Image Assets/APEX original table.png" alt="Apex table example" width=600>




      <li>For each line of sizing chart,
        locate the corresponding attribute in the customer sizing chart and enter it into the
        <b>USER</b> column of the APEX chart.  Note that only one sized garment is made with an APEX run.
      </li> <img src="Image Assets/PilotCustomerSizingChart.png" width=600
        alt="shows pilot customer sizing chart tech pack">
    </ol>



    <p>The pain point is moving the sizing information by hand in part because of potential error, but more importantly
      <b>because the labeling and order in the charts may differ!</b>
    </p>
    <h2>Useful insights</h2>
    <p>The APEX sizing chart screen allows the APEX programmer to save and load the APEX chart as a .csv. </p>
    <p>The minimum requirement on the customer tech pack sizing chart is that it needs to be machine readable to convert
      it to
      a 'flat' spreadsheet that is saved as a .csv file.
      In this demo the flat spreadsheet was produced by hand. Proposed solutions will appear in the 
      Build Sizing
      Synonyms Design Proposal</p>
    <p>In a video recording Jackie walked Ursula through the translation process from customer sheet (called the
      CustomerPilot)
      to the corresponding APEX cells. By hand,
      Ursula created a two column spreadsheet matching the names according to Jackie's talk through. Ursula also created
      a two column sheet for the sizing types, e.g S/Small, M/Medium etc.
      Proposed solutions will appear in the Build Sizing Synonyms Design Proposal</p>
    <p>Note that the sizing charts display measurements in 'string fractions', but the APEX sizing chart .csv produces
      real numbers. This has been solved going from string fraction to real but not in reverse. It appears we won't need
      that as explained in the Build Sizing Synonyms Design Proposal.</p>
    <h2>Solution Description - This is not a specification</h2>
    <p>Given four .csv files:
    <ul>
      <li>the Apex sizing chart</li>
      <li>the flattened Customer Pilot sizing chart,</li>
      <li>the measurement label translations</li>
      <li>the size labels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generate a set of knowledge structures that eventually match a measurement cell in the customer chart to the apex
      chart.</p>
    <p>For each cell in the specified column in the customer .csv, replace the corresponding cell in the APEX .csv</p>
